# gkeep-to-obsidian

Convert Google Keep notes to simplified Markdown documents for offline editing
or importing into some collection of text notes or a knowledge management
system (such as Obsidian).

## Known limitations

* If converting labels to folders only the first label lexicographically is
  considered
* Archives exported from Google Takeout flatten list notes and so element
  nesting is lost
